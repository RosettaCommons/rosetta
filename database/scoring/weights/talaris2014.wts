# The Talaris2014 score function represents a small modification to the
# Talaris2013 score function: the weights are all scaled upwards so that
# fa_atr has a weight of 1.0; then the hydrogen bond strengths are decreased
# by 20%.  This has the effect of keeping the hbond strengths fixed while
# everything else gets stronger.
#
# The benchmarking performed for the O'Meara et al. (2014) hbond paper
# showed that weakening the hbond weights by 20% improved sequence recovery,
# rotamer recovery, and decoy discrimination.  This weight set is not
# (currently) the official gold standard weight set for Rosetta, though its
# use is encouraged.  It may be activated by using the -talaris2014 flag.
#
# Reference energies were fit with optE on Jane Richardson's HiQ54 benchmark
# set in triplicate, and tested on the Ding & Dokholyan 38 set.  The
# set of reference energies with the highest sequence recovery (39.8%) was
# chosen.
