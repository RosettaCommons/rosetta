# The Talaris2013 score function combines several improvements to the previous
# default score function, score12: the 2010 Dunbrack Rotamer Library,
# the sp2 hydrogen bond potential, an explicit electrostatics term with a
# distance dependent dielectric (and a removal of the previous knowledge-
# based electrostatic potential, fa_pair), an adjustment to the LK_DGFREE
# parameters for four atom types, the 05.2009 ideal coordinates for
# the amino acids, an expansion of hydroxyl sampling for serine and
# threonine, the use of bicubic-spline interpolation in our knowledge-
# based potentials, an improved disulfide potential, and an analytic
# evaluation of our Lennard-Jones and EEF1 potentials.
#
# Reference energies were fit with optE on Jane Richardson's HiQ54 benchmark
# set in triplicate, and tested on the Ding & Dokholyan 38 set.  The
# set of reference energies with the highest sequence recovery (39.4%) was
# chosen.
