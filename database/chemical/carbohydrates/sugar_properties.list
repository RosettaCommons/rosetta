# A list of allowed properties in carbohydrate .params and patch files.

# Any properties added to this list will be ignored when a ResidueType is
# constructed but still saved in the properties_ data member.  These properies
# will instead be processed by the read_and_set_properties() method of
# CarbohydrateInfo.

# If the 1st character of a property is a number, it is a sugar modification.
# Otherwise, it is a regular property or a modification for which the position
# is inherent, such as uronic acid.  The patch system is set up such that only
# one modification can occur at each position.  The position of any modifica-
# tion is used in the proper IUPAC naming of the residue.  Most modifications
# listed here should come in sets of nine, one property for each possible
# position 1 through 9.

# Handling for regular properties must be explicitly defined within
# read_and_set_properties().  Handling for modifications with positions is
# general, with 1) the position being extracted and stored, 2) all-caps con-
# verted to lower case, and 3) underscores replaced with spaces.  This string
# is stored in the modifications_ vector, which has a size corresponding to the
# number of carbon atoms in the saccharide residue.
