# This HOH params is currently a direct copy of TP3.params
# Its in fa_standard so that some PDBs can get HOH read in directly without cleanup.
# (TP3.params looks for the residue name "WAT" in PDBs)
# Might potentially want to unify with TP3.params.

# taken from TP3 params in amber: dat/leap/lib/solvents.cmd

PROPERTIES

NBR_ATOM O

## hack -- max distance from hbond anchor atom to farthest O position, since packing assumes that NBR_ATOM doesnt move during packing which is not true with repackable position waters...
## need a better solution for this
##
NBR_RADIUS 3.2
#NBR_RADIUS 0.0 ## distance from O to farthest heavyatom
