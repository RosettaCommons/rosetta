# This used to be a direct copy of TP3.params but is now modified
# for use with Frank and Ryan's solvation methods, giving the
# water its own atom types for parameterization with the beta-nov16 ff
# Did not want to use the TP3 residue type, since TP3 implies a particular
# set of parameters and liquid behavior that is not matched here

## hack -- max distance from hbond anchor atom to farthest O position, since packing assumes that NBR_ATOM doesnt move during packing which is not true with repackable position waters...
## need a better solution for this
