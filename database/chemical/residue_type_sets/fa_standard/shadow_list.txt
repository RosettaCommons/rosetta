# This file lists the official PDB Ligand IDs which are
# provided by this residue type set with name3 which match
# the official PDB ligand ID. 
#
# The primary purpose of this list is to help with loading
# of PDB components - if an ligand ID is on this list, we
# shouldn't load it from the components file.
