## The information for the following was calculated by taking the arithmetic mean 
##   of data taken from 31 actual samples from RCSB (unfortunately there aren't many of them
##   when NMR structures and homologues with >70% similarity are excluded):
##   NZ-CH / CH-OH / CH-CH3 bond lengths, CE-NZ-CH / NZ-CH-OH / NZ-CH-CH3 bond angles
##
## The dihedral angle for placing CH and CH3 are set to the mean values of the rotamer bins 
##   with the highest probabilities.
##
## The information for placing 1HZ was based on LYS.params; the 180 degrees used for placing 
##   the OH atom ensures that it is in the same plane as CH, NZ, and CH3.
