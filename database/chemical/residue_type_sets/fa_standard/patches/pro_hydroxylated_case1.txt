## fullatom protein C(4)-hydroxylation patch for proline
## By Andy M. Chen, June 2009, achen39@jhu.edu

NAME pro_hydroxylated_case1
## "Case 1" = placing the hydroxyl group on the opposite side of the ring as the carbonyl O of the backbone (~95% of all cases)
TYPES HYDROXYLATION1

## general requirements for this patch

## now we search for a case that matches the residue, take the first one
## so put generic case last

## We use HOD rather than HD1 because for some input PDBs HD1 is the delta
## carbons's hydrogen, which would cause them to be mistyped as hydroxyproline

## The hydroxyl group adds an extra proton chi. Because the hydroxyl group could 
##   replace either of the two hydrogens bonded to CG, TWO chi angles are used here:
##   the first one (#4) to place the oxygen, and the second (#5) to place the hydrogen.
##
## [Note that numbering starts at 4 instead of 3 because PRO.params defines three chi angles, 
##   with the last one involving a virtual atom.]

ADD_CHI 4  CA   CB   CG   OD1
ADD_CHI 5  CB   CG   OD1  HOD


## The information for the following was calculated by taking the arithmetic mean 
##   of data taken from actual samples from RCSB (2324 for OD1, 1481 for HOD):
##   CG-OD1 bond length, OD-HOD bond length, CB-CG-OD1 bond angle, CG-OD1-HOD bond angle
##
## The dihedral angle for placing OD1 was taken from the observed sample with the lowest stdev7
##   (standard deviation of the 7 samples including itself and the 3 above and below it).
##
## The rationale behind using stdev7 is that the global minimum in stdev7, which implies 
##   a narrow distribution, should theoretically correspond to the energetically 
##   most favorable microstate (assuming zero extra information about neighboring atoms).
##
## For HOD, the minimum stdev7 was observed at -179.98 degrees, which was simply rounded to 
##   the ideal angle for the anti conformation (+/- 180 degrees).
##
## 1HG, which is bonded to the gamma C, has to be re-packed using information from PRO.params
##   to ensure that it doesn't clash with the added oxygen.

## Manually define rotamer bins for chi 4 using data from the 2324 samples.
##   Note: The rotamers are listed in the order of decreasing frequency.
##   The percentages do not add up to 100% due to rounding and exclusion of "Case 2" samples (~5%).
