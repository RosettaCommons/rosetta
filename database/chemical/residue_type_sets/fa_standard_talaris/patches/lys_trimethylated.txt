## now we search for a case that matches the residue, take the first one

## these are the operations involved
DELETE_ATOM 1HZ ## This amine hydrogen is now a carbon atom
DELETE_ATOM 2HZ ## This amine hydrogen is now also a carbon atom
DELETE_ATOM 3HZ ## This amine hydrogen is now a carbon atom as well

ADD_ATOM  CM1 CH3  CT3  0.12
## Note: the first "CM1" refers to the fact that the added carbon 
##   is part of a "m"ethyl group. A more systematic naming would be "CH1"
##   since that's the "eta carbon," but the CM1/2/3 code is more commonly seen.
## The 0.12 charge was estimated by comparing the difference between 
##   "C bonded to 3 H's" and "C bonded to C and 2 H's" in existing params files 
##   (-0.27 vs. -0.18) and then applying the 0.09 correction onto the charge 
##   given for the epsilon C of lysine, which is 0.21 (bonded to C, N, and 2 H's)

## The information for the following was calculated by taking the arithmetic mean 
##   of data taken from 33 actual samples from RCSB (with NMR structures and homologues with similarity >70% excluded):
##   NZ-CM1/2/3 bond length, CE-NZ-CM1/2/3 bond angle
##
## The dihedral angle for placing CM1 was simply set to 180 degrees since there is a near-tie 
##   between the three main rotamer bins (around +/-180, -60, and +60 degrees)
##
## The following were based on information in LYS.params:
##   Dihedral angle Dihedral angle for placing CM2 and CM3 
##   (120 degrees was meant to maintain the sp3 configuration around NZ)
