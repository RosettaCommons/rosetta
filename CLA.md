Rosetta Software Contributor License Agreement  
==============================================

Rosetta software (“Software”) is developed and managed collectively by members of the Rosetta Commons, a group of participating institutions. 
The University of Washington (“UW”), lead institution of the Rosetta Commons, acts as steward on its behalf. 
This Agreement allows any person or entity who are not members of the Rosetta Commons to make Contributions (as defined below) to Rosetta Software. 
For the avoidance of doubt, you will not become a member or participating institution of the Rosetta Commons by signing this Agreement.

To clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any Contributor, 
UW must have a signed Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") from each Contributor, indicating agreement with the license terms below. 
This Agreement is for your protection as a Contributor, as well as the protection of the UW, the Rosetta Commons, and its end user licensees. 
It does not change Your rights to use Your own Contributions for any other purpose. 

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to UW. 
In return, neither the UW nor the Rosetta Commons shall use Your Contributions in a way that is contrary to or inconsistent 
with the Rosetta Commons’ objective to develop high performing protein prediction and protein design software and 
make this software and related information broadly available to the scientific community without reach-through. 
Except for the license granted herein, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions. 

1. Definitions. 

You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making a Contribution. 
For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. 
For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, 
whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity. 

"Contribution" means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, 
that is intentionally submitted by You to UW and/or representatives of the Rosetta Commons for inclusion in, or documentation of, the Software. 
For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to UW or its representatives, 
including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, 
or on behalf of, UW or the Rosetta Commons for the purpose of discussing and improving the Software.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, 
You hereby grant to UW and to recipients of Software distributed by UW, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to 
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works. 

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to UW and to recipients of Software distributed by UW 
a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to 
make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Software, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You 
that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Software to which such Contribution(s) were submitted. 
If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that Your Contribution, 
or the Software to which You have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, 
then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Software shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above license. 
If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, 
you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to UW, 
or that your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with UW.

5. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation or that You are authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others).

6. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. 
You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. UW and Rosetta Commons are not obligated to accept or use Your Contributions or offers of support. 
Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, 
either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

7. Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to UW and/or representatives of the Rosetta Commons separately from any Contribution, 
identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) 
of which You are aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]".

8. You agree to notify UW and/or representatives of the Rosetta Commons of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.
