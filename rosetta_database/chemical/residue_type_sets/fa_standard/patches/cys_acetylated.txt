ADD_ATOM  OCD ONH2 O    -0.55 ## Copied from the amide O in Gln; this is the carboxyl oxygen of the acetyl group
ADD_ATOM 1HE  Hapo HA   0.09  ## Methyl hydrogen on the acetyl group; same for 2HE and 3HE

## The information for the following was calculated by taking the arithmetic mean 
##   of data taken from 22 actual samples from RCSB (unfortunately there aren't many of them
##   to begin with, plus that NMR structures and homologues with >70% similarity are excluded):
##   SG-CD / CD-OCD / CD-CE bond lengths, CB-SG-CD / SG-CD-OCD / SG-CD-CE bond angles
##
## The dihedral angle for placing CD and CE are set to the mean values of the rotamer bins 
##   with the highest probabilities. The 180 degrees used for placing 
##   the OH atom ensures that it is in the same plane as CD, SG, and CE.

## Note: The last bin consists of a single sample and is thus given an arbitrary standard devitaion of 20.
##   Based on the distribution of the other samples, it appears that this might be either an outlier 
##   or the lower tail of the -132.92 bin. Since 176.91 degrees is close to the anti conformation, however,
##   the data point is kept as a separate bin.
