AnchoredPDBCreator should produce a single output file, sc_loop_insertBC_1_noFGdel_0001.pdb, plus score.sc and the log file.

Don't expect the pdb to be any good - there aren't enough cycles to get a good result.  If you want to demo it for yourself, use many more cycles.  There may still be sidechain clashes and chainA-chainB clashes - these are ironed out in AnchoredDesign instead.
