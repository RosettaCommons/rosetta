#
# This is a command file.
#
# To make a new test, all you have to do is:
#   1.  Make a new directory under tests/
#   2.  Put a file like this (named "command") into that directory.
#
# The contents of this file will be passed to the shell (Bash or SSH),
# so any legal shell commands can go in this file.
# Or comments like this one, for that matter.
#
# Variable substiution is done using Python's printf format,
# meaning you need a percent sign, the variable name in parentheses,
# and the letter 's' (for 'string').
#
# Available variables include:
#   workdir     the directory where test input files have been copied,
#               and where test output files should end up.
#   minidir     the base directory where Mini lives
#   database    where the Mini database lives
#   bin         where the Mini binaries live
#   binext      the extension on binary files, like ".linuxgccrelease"
#
# The most important thing is that the test execute in the right directory.
# This is especially true when we're using SSH to execute on other hosts.
# All command files should start with this line:
#

cd %(workdir)s
