#
# This is a command file.
#
# To make a new test, all you have to do is:
#   1.  Make a new directory under tests/
#   2.  Put a file like this (named "command") into that directory.
#
# The contents of this file will be passed to the shell (Bash or SSH),
# so any legal shell commands can go in this file.
# Or comments like this one, for that matter.
#
# Variable substiution is done using Python's printf format,
# meaning you need a percent sign, the variable name in parentheses,
# and the letter 's' (for 'string').
#
# Available variables include:
#   workdir     the directory where test input files have been copied,
#               and where test output files should end up.
#   minidir     the base directory where Mini lives
#   database    where the Mini database lives
#   bin         where the Mini binaries live
#   binext      the extension on binary files, like ".linuxgccrelease"
#
# The most important thing is that the test execute in the right directory.
# This is especially true when we're using SSH to execute on other hosts.
# All command files should start with this line:


cd %(workdir)s

[ -x %(bin)s/dgdp.%(binext)s ] || exit 1
# not yet
# [ -x %(bin)s/cryo_assembly.%(binext)s ] || exit 1
#


[ -x %(minidir)s/scripts/python/public/cryo_dock_and_assemble/cryo_dock_and_assemble.py ] || exit 1
%(python)s %(minidir)s/scripts/python/public/cryo_dock_and_assemble/cryo_dock_and_assemble.py \
	--rosetta_bin_location %(raw_bin_dir)s \
	--rosetta_database %(database)s \
	--bin_extension .%(binext)s \
	--premade_json input.dgdp_only.json \
	--output_dir dgdp_out \
	--name integration_test \
	--dock_only \
	--run_locally \
	2>&1 \
	| egrep -vf ../../ignore_list \
	| egrep -v "Port .* is already in use." \
	| egrep -v "Hosting the HTTP server on port .* instead" \
		> run_cryo_dock_and_assemble.log

for logfile in $(find dgdp_out -name '*.log'); do
	egrep -vf ../../ignore_list ${logfile} > ${logfile}.filt
	mv ${logfile} ${logfile}.ignore
done

test "${PIPESTATUS[0]}" != '0' && exit 1 || true  # Check if the first executable in pipe line return error and exit with error code if so

#
# After that, do whatever you want.
# Files will be diffed verbatim, so if you want to log output and compare it,
# you'll need to filter out lines that change randomly (e.g. timings).
# Prefixing your tests with "nice" is probably good form as well.
# Don't forget to use -testing:INTEGRATION_TEST  so results are reproducible.
# Here's a typical test for a Mini binary, assuming there's a "flags" file
# in this directory too:
#
## %(bin)s/MY_MINI_PROGRAM.%(binext)s %(additional_flags)s @flags -database %(database)s -testing:INTEGRATION_TEST  2>&1 \
##     | egrep -v 'Finished.+in [0-9]+ seconds.' \
##     | egrep -v 'Dunbrack library took .+ seconds to load' \
##     > log
#
# Or if you don't care whether the logging output changes:
#
## %(bin)s/MY_MINI_PROGRAM.%(binext)s %(additional_flags)s @flags -database %(database)s -testing:INTEGRATION_TEST  2>&1 \
##     > /dev/null
#
