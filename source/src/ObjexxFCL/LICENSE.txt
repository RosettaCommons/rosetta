Software License Agreement for the Objexx Fortran Compatibility Library

The following License Agreement applies to any user of the Objexx Fortran
Compatibility Library.  By use of the software, you indicate your acceptance of
the following Software License Agreement.  If you do not agree to the terms of
this Agreement, promptly return any media and printed materials to Objexx
Engineering for a full refund.

1.  This is a legal agreement between Objexx Engineering, Inc. ("Licensor") and
Licensee as defined in the Addendum, who is being licensed to use the Objexx
Fortran Compatibility Library computer software and associated documentation
("Software").

2.  Licensee acknowledges that this is only a limited nonexclusive license.
Licensor is and remains the owner of all titles, rights, and interests in the
Software.  The Software is protected by United States copyright laws and
international treaty provisions.  Therefore, you must treat the Software like
any other copyrighted material except as otherwise provided for in this License.

3.  This License permits use of the Software solely with Licensee's designated
computer software applications ("Applications") as defined in the Addendum.
Neither Licensee nor any other party may use the Software for another purpose
without licensing the Software for that use from Licensor.

4.  This License permits Licensee to make an unlimited number of copies of the
Software and to install the Software on more than one computer system for its
own use with the Applications.  Licensee may modify the Software for use in the
Applications without additional licensing but may not remove the copyright
notice from the Software, charge a fee for the Software, or otherwise imply or
assert ownership of the Software.  A notice may be added to indicate that
portions of the revised Software were added by Licensee and are not covered by
Licensor's copyright notice.

5.  This License permits Licensee to include and distribute the Software in
source or binary form with current and future versions of the Applications
without limitation and without payment to Licensor.  Within the limitations of
the Applications' licensing, those parties may modify the Software for use in
the Applications subject to the same conditions as apply to Licensee.

6.  This License applies to any other versions or extensions of the Software
provided by Licensor to Licensee unless a different License is agreed upon by
Licensor and Licensee.

8.  This Software is subject to a limited warranty.  Licensor warrants to
Licensee that the physical medium on which this Software is distributed is free
from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and to the best of
Licensor's knowledge Licensee's use of this Software according to the
documentation is not an infringement of any third party's intellectual property
rights.  This limited warranty lasts for a period of 90 days after delivery.  No
agent of Licensor is authorized to make any other warranties or to modify this
limited warranty.  Any action for breach of this limited warranty must be
commenced within one year of the expiration of the warranty.  Because some
jurisdictions do not allow any limit on the length of an implied warranty, the
above limitation may not apply to this Licensee.  If the law does not allow
disclaimer of implied warranties, then any implied warranty is limited to 90
days after delivery of the Software to Licensee.  Licensee has specific legal
rights pursuant to this warranty and, depending on Licensee's jurisdiction, may
have additional rights.

9.  Licensor DOES NOT WARRANT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET
YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR
ERROR FREE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE
IS WITH YOU.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, Licensor AND
ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WITH REGARD TO THE SOFTWARE AND THE ACCOMPANYING
WRITTEN MATERIALS.  THIS LIMITED WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS.  YOU
MAY HAVE OTHERS WHICH VARY FROM STATE/JURISDICTION TO STATE/JURISDICTION.

10.  THE SOFTWARE IS INTENDED TO BE USED ONLY BY TRAINED PROFESSIONALS AND IS
NOT TO BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT, TESTING, SAFETY AND UTILITY.
Licensor IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE OF ANY RESULTS OBTAINED FROM USING THE
SOFTWARE.

send Licensee a replacement copy of the Software, at Licensor's expense, or
issue a full refund.

12.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, LICENSOR IS NOT LIABLE TO LICENSEE FOR ANY
DAMAGES, INCLUDING COMPENSATORY, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, CONNECTED WITH OR RESULTING FROM THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT
OR LICENSEE'S USE OF THIS SOFTWARE.  Licensee's jurisdiction may not allow such
a limitation of damages, so this limitation may not apply.

13.  To the extent allowed by Washington State Law, Licensee agrees to defend
and indemnify Licensor and hold Licensor harmless from all claims, losses,
damages, complaints, or expenses connected with or resulting from Licensee's
business operations.

modeling, protein docking, ligand docking, protein design, interface
design, interface energetic analyses, NMR utilities and nucleic acid
calculations.  Rosetta has been developed by researchers at a number of
universities including the University of Washington, Johns Hopkins
University, University of North Carolina, University of California at
San Francisco, and the University of California at Santa Cruz, and Los
Alamos National Laboratories.

2.  For the purposes of this License "Applications" refers to current
and all future versions of this Rosetta software and any software that
