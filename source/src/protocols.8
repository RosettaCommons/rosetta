This file (and all the other core.* and protocols.* files) exists because scons expects each item in the list "projects" to have a directory or file in src with the same name.  Since we split core and protocols into multiple libraries but left them all in the same directory, we need these dummy files to keep scons from dying.

This is a sort of silly requirement, and I feel like there must be a better solution, I haven't found it yet.
