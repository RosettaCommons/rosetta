/// @brief Parses and stores a disulfide file.
/// @details Initiallizing a DisulfideFile is a lightweight operation.
/// The heavy lifting occurs the first time disulfides() is called. This parses
/// the file and caches the resulting pairs of residues.
/// Subsequent calls to disulfides() are fast since they don't reparse the file
/// but merely reinterpret the results in terms of the specified.
///
/// @section format File Format
/// The disulfide file format is pretty flexible. It looks for three kinds of lines:
///  - '12 42' Lines with two integers are interpreted as a disulfide
///    bond, indexed by internal rosetta residue number, i.e. the 12th and 42nd
///    residues from the start of the pose.
///  - '12A 42A' If a single character is appended to the numbers, DisulfideFile
///    assumes that these refer to the pdb number and chain, i.e. the residues
///    of chain A numbered 12 and 42 in the pdb.
///  - 'SSBOND   1 CYS A   12    CYS A   42' The
///    <a href="http://www.wwpdb.org/documentation/format32/sect6.html#SSBOND">
///    PDB format</a> for disulfide bond annotations.
///
/// All lines not matching these criteria are silently ignored. This implies
/// that whole pdb files can usually be used unaltered as disulfide files, since
/// the SSBOND entries are extracted and all else is ignored.
///
/// Question from rhiju, 2014 -- I don't see handling of '12A' or SSBOND cases in
///  DisulfideFile.cc -- is someone going to check that in?
