# To add a new variant type to Rosetta for use in .params files, patch files,
# and ResidueTypes, simply add a string to this list and run
# update_ResidueType_enum_files.py.

##############################################################################

# A variant is a particular way of modifying a ResidueType
# This differs from a property, in that variants describe the modification as a whole
# whereas properties describe particular characteristics of a ResidueType (modified or not)

# The current set of variants fall under three general categories
#
# * Modification of connectivity
# * Modification of chemistry
# * Alteration of representation 
#
# This isn't a strictly exclusive enumeration, though, as many variants 
# will descibe modification of connectivity by addition of additional chemistry
#
# One thing to keep in mind when adding new variant types is that variants
# should be somewhat context independant -- that is, the variant should describe
# the modification to the ResidueType as it is, rather than describing where it's going to be used.
# (Or in other words, variants describe how the ResidueType is modified,
# not in which contexts the modifications are intended to be used.)
# Some of the names don't live up to that standard, but are kept around for historical reasons

# NOTE: The variants here are organized based on their underlying meaning, rather than current implementation. 
# Some variants are actually only implemented for protein/RNA/etc, though theoretically could be broader.
