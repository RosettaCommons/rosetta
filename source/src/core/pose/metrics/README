Notes on Pose Metrics (this file is src/core/pose/metrics/README):

(Some files have been moved. see also src/core/pose/metrics/simple_calculators as well.)

Pose "metrics" is a general framework for holding data which is returned when asked for. Space for this data is allocated 
the first time the data is requested, and the data is computed. The data is then cached, and recomputed as needed.

The PoseMetricContainer holds a series of named PoseMetricCalculators - each calculator contains functionality to compute 
data corresponding to one or more "metrics". Before it is used, a calculator must be "registered" (ie. given a name). 
This registration process allows multiple instances of the same calculator type (eg. a "distance" calculator which operates 
on a pair of atoms predefined in the constructor of the calculator).

Important note: a calculator should only be registered ONCE for a given Rosetta run. Upon registration, it is accessible 
to all Pose instances indefinitely.

Sample usage:

// Register a "SasaCalculator", giving it the name "sasa"
core::pose::metrics::PoseMetricCalculatorOP sasa_calculator = new devel::PoseMetricCalculators::SasaCalculator;
core::pose::metrics::CalculatorFactory::Instance().register_calculator( "sasa", sasa_calculator );

// Use this Calculator to report the total sasa for a given Pose
basic::MetricValue<Real> mr;			// instantiate a "MetricValue" object of type Real
pose.metric("sasa","total_sasa",mr);        // invoke the pose.metric method, to use the "sasa" calculator to compute the total sasa
std::cout << "Total SASA is: " << mr.value() << std::endl;     // report the value

The "MetricValue" object is a wrapper which allows the pose.metric function to data of any type. In the example above, 
the "total_sasa" metric expects to return a "Real" - for this reason, a "MetricValue<Real>" must be passed in. Failure 
to pass in the correct type will produce an assert failure in a debug build (and unpredictably wrong results in a release 
build). The value is retrieved from the MetricValue object through the "value()" method.

This framework is intended to be extensible, and adding new metrics / new calculators is straightforward. The steps for each are outlined below:


Instructions on adding a new metric to an existing calculator:

1) Include the data as private member data of the appropriate calculator (eg. src/protocols/toolbox/PoseMetricCalculators/SasaCalculator.hh).

2) Write code to fill this data in the "recompute" function of the calculator (eg. src/protocols/toolbox/PoseMetricCalculators/SasaCalculator.cc).

3) Write code to report this data in the "lookup" and "print" functions of the calculator (eg. src/protocols/toolbox/PoseMetricCalculators/SasaCalculator.cc).


Instructions on adding a new type of calculator (see src/protocols/toolbox/PoseMetricCalculators/SasaCalculator for an example):

1) Decide whether the data stored by the calculator needs to be recomputed when the structure (conformation) changes, 
the energy changes, or the sequence changes (the latter is not yet fully implemented). Write a new class for the calculator 
which derives from the appropriate base class (StructureDependentCalculator, EnergyDependentCalculator, etc.) in 
PoseMetricCalculatorBase.hh.

2) The new calculator class should define its own "lookup", "print", and "recompute" methods, but NOT anything else from 
the base class. Any values returned by "lookup" (and "print") should be stored as private member data.

3) Make sure to include assert statements with function calls to "check_cast" for each lookup metric.
