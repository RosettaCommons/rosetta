TODO:
XX Add check that first atom of a metal residue type is the metal.
XX Add check that metalbinding residues define metalbinding atoms.
XX Add check that params files with metalbinding atoms are metalbinding residues.
XX Add distance constraints.
XX Add angle constraints.
XX Add Cu and Co.
XX Add support for more than 4 VIRTs, and add a virt counting function to residue / residuetype.
XX Move metal detection to pose utilities.
XX Move constraint adding to pose utilities.
XX In convert_res_name in core/io/pdb/file_data_fixup.cc, add logic for handling "ZN ", " ZN", "ZN1", "ZN2", etc.
XX Automatically set parent of metal to nearest metal-binding residue on pdb import.
XX Add flags for constraints and metal detection (as well as for constraint strength, inclusion of angle constraints, and detection radius cutoff).
XX Add tracer to core/pose/metalloproteins/util.cc.
XX Automatically turn on constraint weights.
XX Add automatic constraint adding and metal detection to import_pose
XX Remove debugging output from util.cc.
XX Remove stdio.hh from util.cc.
XX Add BPY to the NCAAs.
-- Test cart_bonded and figure out what to do about protein-metal bonds...

To add to documentation:
-- Changes to -inout:*** flag group (for CONECT records)
-- A section on how to deal with metalloproteins in Rosetta
-- A section on how to deal with noncanonicals in Rosetta

Tests:
-- Add unit tests
-- Add integration tests
