*** Building PyRosetta from source

    In some cases it might be beneficial to build PyRosetta from source instead of using pre-build binaries.
Here is the list of cases when it might be a good idea to consider building from source:

 - You need to have bindings for your own custom C++ code that is not part of Rosetta master branch.

 - PyRosetta need to run by custom-build Python (for example if you would like to use some Python packages
   from MacPorts, Fink or Homebrew who deploy its own version of Python)

 - You need to use different version of Python.

 - You can't install GLIBC required by pre-build binaries.

 - You running on 32Bit system.


1. Deploying PyRosetta build environment
    Before we can compile PyRosetta we will need setup PyRosetta build environment. Step-by-step instruction for
this procedure is available in: main/source/src/python/bindings/building.txt in Rosetta main Git repository. We
also provide python script that automate it. It is available in Rosetta/tools repository in
rosetta/tools/PyRosetta.develop/DeployPyRosetta.py. Please run 'DeployPyRosetta.py --help' to see available
configuration options. After DeployPyRosetta.py script is run in to completion it should produce dir containing
all necessary tools and generate BuildPyRosetta.sh shell script that could be copied in to Rosetta source dir to
compile PyRosetta.


2. Building PyRosetta
    After successfully deploying PyRosetta build environment copy generated BuildPyRosetta.sh in to main Rosetta
source dir: /rosetta/main/source/BuildPyRosetta.sh and run it within this dir in order to build PyRosetta. Script
will parse Rosetta C++ code, generate source code for Python bindings and compile it and store results in to
/rosetta/main/source/src/python/bindings/rosetta dir. For full list of available command line options please
run 'BuildPyRosetta.sh --help'.


----- Deploying PyRosetta build environment by hand: -----

Requirements -------------------------------------
    To build python bindings on Linux system you have to make sure that the following packages are installed and accessible (added to your path variable):

    - Python >= 2.5
    - cmake

    - GCCXML >=0.9
    - pygccxml
    - Py++
    - Full version of Boost lib (including Boost python) >=1.34

Below is instruction on how to perform local installation (without root rights) of packages GCCXML, pygccxml, Py++ and Boost.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Creating prefix dir, where all software will be installed to:
mkdir ~/y
echo '#!/bin/sh'  >~/y/y.sh
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/y/bin:$PATH' >>~/y/y.sh
echo 'export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/y/lib/python2.5/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH' >>~/y/y.sh
# if you building on Dig's add this line: echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/y/lib' >>~/y/y.sh
chmod +x ~/y/y.sh
source ~/y/y.sh
# in future session use 'source ~/y/y.sh' before starting to build  bindings

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installing Python 2.5 and cmake (if you trying to build on BakerLab digs this step is req. for you)

1. Install Python 2.5.* from python.org:
 $ wget http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.5.4/Python-2.5.4.tar.bz2
 $ tar -vjxf Python-2.5.4.tar.bz2   # unpack
 # Building
 $ cd Python-2.5.4
 $ ./configure --enable-shared --prefix=/home/<YOUR_LOGIN>/y  # if you trying to build on digs use --prefix=/work/<your_login>/y instead
 $ make && make install

2. CMake
 # download
 $ wget http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.6/cmake-2.6.3.tar.gz
 $ tar -vzxf cmake-2.6.3.tar.gz
 # Building
 $ cd cmake-2.6.3
 $ ./configure --prefix=~/y
 $ make && make install

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Installing GCCXML:
mkdir gccxml-cvs
cd gccxml-cvs
# getting the source
#cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@www.gccxml.org:/cvsroot/GCC_XML co -D 2009-02-03 gccxml
cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@www.gccxml.org:/cvsroot/GCC_XML co -D 2009-04-15 gccxml
# compiling
mkdir gccxml-build
cd gccxml-build
cmake ../gccxml -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=~/y

make && make install

# Currently gccxml does not support gcc version 4.2 and up, so you may want to make it use
# older gcc version by supplying -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/some/path/to/gnu-c++ like this:
# cmake ../gccxml -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=~/y -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/gcc-bin/4.1.2/c++
# Or better yet you can  overwriting gccxml_config to set the correct c++ version ------------------
# mv ~/y/share/gccxml-0.9/gccxml_config ~/y/share/gccxml-0.9/gccxml_config.original
# echo 'GCCXML_COMPILER="/usr/bin/c++-4.0"' >~/y/share/gccxml-0.9/gccxml_config
# echo 'GCCXML_CXXFLAGS=""' >>~/y/share/gccxml-0.9/gccxml_config


cd
# Check installation, following command should report something like: GCC-XML version 0.9.0
gccxml


# Installing pygccxml
# download pygccxml from https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=118209
unzip pygccxml-1.0.0.zip
cd pygccxml-1.0.0
python setup.py install --prefix=~/y

# Installing Py++
# download pyplusplus from https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=118209
unzip Py++-1.0.0.zip
cd Py++-1.0.0
python setup.py install --prefix=~/y

# Checking installation, following command sequence of commands should report something like: '1.0.0 1.0.0'
python
>>> import pygccxml, pyplusplus
>>> print pygccxml.__version__, pyplusplus.__version__
1.0.0 1.0.0
>>> exit()

# Installing Boost 1_38
# Download and extract source from boost.org
./configure --prefix=/home/<your_home_folder>/y  # if you trying to build on digs use --prefix=/work/<your_login>/y instead
# Note: you have to specify absolute path in '--prefix=...' in line above, saying just '~/y' will not work.
make
make install
# Deprecated --with-python-root=/opt/local --prefix=/home/<your_home_folder>/y

# Manyaly adjust BOOST_PYTHON configuration
in file ~/y/include/boost-1_38/boost/python/detail/preprocessor.hpp line 29 change
#  define BOOST_PYTHON_MAX_ARITY 15
  -->
#  define BOOST_PYTHON_MAX_ARITY 20


#     Building Python bindings
#
# At this point all necessary packages are installed, we can try to build Python bindings
# Check revsion number at line 0 of this file and update your src tree to this revesion
svn up src -r<put revision numebr here>

cd path_to_rosetta/rosetta_source/src/python/bindings

# if you using using system installation of Python (for example for Mac OS build),
# then add '-I/usr/include/python2.5' to command line below.
./BuildBindings.py -I/home/<your_home_folder>/y/include/boost \
    -I/home/<your_home_folder>/y/include \
    -L /home/<your_home_folder>/y/lib/ -L .


# Test results:
python TestBindings.py

Colin's Notes on Building Bindings for Mac OS X 10.5:

I used MacPorts to install Boost.Python and GCCXML.

sudo port install boost+python25 gccxml-devel

Check that Boost.Python is linking against the preinstalled python library:

otool -L /opt/local/lib/libboost_python-mt.dylib

unzip pygccxml-1.0.0.zip
cd pygccxml-1.0.0
python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..

unzip pyplusplus-1.0.0.zip
cd Py++-1.0.0
python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install

./BuildBindings.py -I/usr/include/python2.5 -I/opt/local/include -I/opt/local/include/boost -L/usr/lib -L/opt/local/lib --boost_lib boost_python-mt

This is what I used to update bindings:

./BuildBindings.py -I/usr/include/python2.5 -I/opt/local/include -I/opt/local/include/boost -L/usr/lib -L/opt/local/lib --boost_lib boost_python-mt -d --one-lib-file -u


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Environment variables set up that allow to import PyRosetta from location
different then src/python/bindings. Replace 'current' with appropriate
absolute path to your src/python/bindings folder.

Mac:
export LIBPATH=current/rosetta:$LIBPATH
export PYTHONPATH=current:$PYTHONPATH
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=current:current/rosetta


Linux:
export LIBPATH=current/rosetta:$LIBPATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=current/rosetta
export PYTHONPATH=current:$PYTHONPATH
