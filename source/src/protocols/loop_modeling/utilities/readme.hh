/// @namespace protocols::loop_modeling::utilities
///
/// @brief Generally useful loop-sampling meta-algorithms.
///
/// @details This namespace contains generally useful LoopMover subclasses that
/// don't directly perform loop sampling.  For example, the AcceptanceCheck
/// class makes it possible create protocols with additional acceptance checks.
/// The LoopMoverGroup class makes it easy to work with a collection of loop
/// movers.
