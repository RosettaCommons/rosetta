----- Use ninja_build.py -----
The easiest way to use cmake + ninja is to use main/source/ninja_build.py.

See below for instruction for installing cmake and ninja.

After proper installation, run

./ninja_build.py (assuming you are at source/)

to obtain a list of help info.

Quick examples:

./ninja_build.py r -remake (Release build, use -remake for the first run)
./ninja_build.py r (build afterwards if you did not edit *.src.settings
./ninja_build.py d (Debug build)
./ninja_build.py u (Unit test build, see below)

----- Compiling with cmake + ninja -----

After checking out a fresh version run these commands to
get a full release build of rosetta:

./make_project.py all
cd build_release
cmake -G Ninja
ninja  

of if you want to see the actual g++ commands (good for debugging):

ninja -v

Some more information on installing ninja below (its easy with git, which you presumably already have). 
Ninja is a very efficient replacement for 'make'. If you want to use cmake with 'make' instead, see below.

----- Building and running Unit Tests -----

Usage is straightforward, and similar to regular CMake builds:

#Build using ninja_build.py:

cd rosetta/main/source/
./ninja_build.py -remake unit 
(Omit "remake" if you haven't edited any *.src.settings since the last run)

or just use the command lines:

./make_project.py all
cd ./build_unit
cmake -G Ninja 
ninja 

#Test

cd rosetta/main/source/
test/run.py -C -j8 --mute all (Don't forget the "-C")


----- Installing CMake + Ninja ---

1. Download the latest version of cmake (> v2.8.8). 

######The following is for cmake 2.8.8 only#################
Ninja is turned on by default for linux but not for Apple in cmake 2.8.8.

Turn on Ninja (For Apple machine)
Edit cmake-2.8.8/Source/CMakeLists.txt:

Find the following lines :
if(WIN32 OR APPLE)
  SET(_CMAKE_DEFAULT_NINJA_VALUE FALSE)
endif()

and change it to :
if(WIN32)
  SET(_CMAKE_DEFAULT_NINJA_VALUE FALSE)
endif()
############################################################

Now compile and install cmake. Run  

./bootstrap
make
sudo make install

2. Download ninja via github:

 git clone https://github.com/martine/ninja.git

 and run 

   python bootstrap.py


3. Make sure you have both 'cmake' and 'ninja' available from shell command.
If not add them to your $PATH environmental variable.

----- Using make instead of ninja -----
If want to compile with make instead of ninja, you can type.

./make_project.py all
cd build_release
cmake .
make

you can also make individual executables by typing, for example

make relax

or individual sub libraries:

make core

if you are compiling an app and you haven't touch neither core or protocols
you can skip checking this dependencies by using /fast. for example:

make myapp/fast

If you want to see the actual g++ commands the make issues (good for debugging)
issue the command like this

make VERBOSE=1
