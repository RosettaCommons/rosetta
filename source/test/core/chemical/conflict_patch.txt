## The information for the following was calculated by taking the arithmetic mean 
##   of data taken from 166 samples of RCSB's PDB files (with NMR structures excluded):
##   OH-S bond length, S-O1/O2/O3 bond length, CZ-OH-S bond angle, OH-S-O1/O2/O3 bond angle
##   For dihedral angles, O1 is given the anti conformation (180 degrees), 
##     while O2 and O3 are placed in their ideal positions for a tetrahedral configuration.
##
## The dihedral angle for placing S was taken from the mean value of the rotamer bin 
##   with the highest probability.

ADD_PROPERTY CHARGED ## For the sulfate group


## Chi 3 was a proton chi in TYR.params. Since the hydrogen atom isn't there anymore, 
##   redefine the fourth atom of chi3 to the added P and then remove the hydrogen.

## Manually define rotamer bins for chi 3 using data from the 166 samples.
##   Note: The rotamers are listed in the order of decreasing frequency.
