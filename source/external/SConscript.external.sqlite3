#this is different from all the other SConscripts.
#typically external libraries have their own build requirements and so
#there is no real way of making a generalized build scheme for any arbitrary
#external library, so we make a function for each library, and then have an
#if statement that goes through and runs the proper function for each project

#if there is a better way of going about this, we should do that, this is pretty hacky
