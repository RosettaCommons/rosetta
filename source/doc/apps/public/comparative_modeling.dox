@section purpose  Purpose
This application was developed to build structural models of proteins using one or more known structures as templates for modeling.

@section algorithm Algorithm
The Rosetta comparative modeling approach is divided into four steps. The first step is generation of alignments to one or more template structures. We currently use external programs for this purpose, including BLAST, PSI-BLAST, HMMER and HHSearch. For more information on the alignment problem as it relates to comparative modeling problem, see Chivian and Baker (2006). The second step is generation of an incomplete model based on the template structure by copying coordinates over the aligned regions and rebuilding the missing parts using loop modeling. For more information, see the documentation for the loop modeling application. The third step is a full-atom refinement of the protein model using the Rosetta full-atom energy function. The final step is a selection of the models using clustering. File formats and command-line flags are detailed below in the @ref comparative_modeling_options "Options" section below).

The current standard protocol is to generate 10,000 separate models using the protocol detailed in this document, select the lowest 10% of models by energy, and then choose clusters using the "Cluster" application."

@section inputs Input Files

@li Fasta file.
Contains the amino acid protein sequence in fasta format.

@li Fragment files.
Generate structural fragment libraries using either the publicly available webserver (http://robetta.bakerlab.org/fragmentsubmit.jsp) or a local installation of the rosetta_fragments package.

@li Native structure (optional).
The native PDB structure may be used for benchmarking. When used, the RMSD to native is calculated for each model and provided as an extra column in the score line.

@li Psipred secondary structure prediction psipred_ss2 file (optional).
The Psipred secondary structure prediction file can be used to pick chainbreak points for loop-modeling, and is optional.

@endverbatim

The "grishin" file format for sequence alignments is listed below:
@verbatim
## t288_ 1be9A_4
# hhsearch_3 33
scores_from_program: 0.000000 0.998400

@endverbatim

The first two lines represent the identifier of the query and template sequences, and 1be9A.pdb must provided on the command-line with the -in:file:template_pdb option (listed above). The string "1be9A_4" should be a unique identifier for the sequence alignment. Alignment identifiers are stored in silent-files, and each structure in a silent-file should store which alignment was used as a template for model building.

See the @ref abinitiorelax_score_extract_options "AbinitioRelax extract options" and @ref abinitiorelax_cluster_options "AbinitioRelax cluster options" for information on how to extract PDBs and cluster silent-files from comparative modeling.
