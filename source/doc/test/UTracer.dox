@page UTracer UTracer tool for simplifying writings of unit tests

UTracer is an object similar to core::util Tracer (see @ref Tracer Tracer documantaion page for more info). It main purpose is to capture user output, compare output with previously saved version and save new version in to '._tmp_' file. In addition UTracer object can be used to capture output of specified channels inside core or protocols lib and compare this outputs to a  file version.

@section CreatingUTracerObject Creating UTracer object.
To create UTracer object you need to supply one argument – name of the file to which output will be compared. For example:
@code
	UTracer UT(“MyFile.u”);
@endcode
will create  UTracer object that will compare all output going in to it to a content of a file “MyFile.u”. (Please use .u extension as default for UTracer files). When doing a comparison current version of output will be saved to a ._tmp_ file, in this case it will be file 'MyFile.u._tmp_'.

@section UsingUTracerObject Using UTracer object.
To use UTracer object simply send output to it using '<<' C++ operator. In additional to handling standard build-in C++ type it is possible to serialize vector, vector1 and map's type. For example:

@code
	UTracer UT(“MyFile.u”);
	Real a,b,c;
	vector<Real> va;
	vector1<Real> v1a;
	map<String, Real> map_string_real;
...
	UT << “Some strings... \n”;
	UT << “Some numbers:” << a << b << c << “\n”;
	UT << “Vector type:” << va << “\n”;
	UT << “Vector1 type:” << v1a << “\n”;
	UT << “map type:” << map_string_real << “\n”;
@endcode

Note: As with Tracer object symbol '\\n' should be used for a new line, instead of using std::endl line symbol.


@section ControllingPrecisionsOfUTracerComparison   Controlling precisions of UTracer comparison.
Currently only float point number can be compared with a specified precisions. It is possible to specify precisions in two ways: absolute and relative.

@subsection absolute_precision 1. Specifying absolute precisions.
Simply calling 'UTracer & delta(double absolute_delta)' will set current acceptble delta for float numbers. Default delta for a new UTracer object is 1e-200. Example:
@code
	UTracer UT(“MyFile.u”);
	Real a,b,c;
	UT.abs_tolerance(.001) << a;  // a will be compared with precisions .001
	UT.abs_tolerance(.01) << b;  // b will be compared with precisions .01
	UT.abs_tolerance(.1) << c;  // b will be compared with precisions .1
@endcode

@subsection relative_precision 2. Specifying relative precisions.
For specifying relative precisions use 'UTracer & relative(double relative_precision)'. When UTracer compare using ralative precision it convert it first to a absolute delta value using this function:
delta = (original_value + new_value)/2. * relative_precision. Where original_value and new_value is a value read from .u file and value serialized to UTracer. Example:
@code
	UTracer UT(“MyFile.u”);
	Real a,b,c;
	UT.rel_tolerance(.001) << a;  // a will be compared with relative precisions .001
	UT.rel_tolerance(.01) << b;  // b will be compared with relative precisions .01
	UT.rel_tolerance(.1) << c;  // b will be compared with relative precisions .1
@endcode

@subsection relative_and_absolute 3. Specifying relative and absolute precisions.
It is possible to effectively use absolute and relative precision in the same time. If both precisions are specified effective delta will be calculated as maximum from absolute and relative delta.
	Suppose we have an array of values ranged from 0 to 100 that we want compare following way: all values should not be different from the original by more then 5% and in the same time we would like to consider value equal if they both below .1 in absolute value. Using UTracer we can do this following way:
@code
	UTracer UT(“MyFile.u”);
	Vector<Real> v;
	...
	UT.abs_tolerance(.1).rel_tolerance(.05);  	// set absolute precision as .1
					// and set relative precision as 5%
	for(i=0; i<v.size(); i++) {
		UT << v[i];
	}
@endcode


Trick: to compare integer number with a precision convert them first to double, and then use UTracer functions 'delta' and 'relative' to compare.

@section CompareLibsChannels Using of UTrace to compare output of specified channels inside core/protocols libs.
It is also possible to use UTracer to monitor and compare output of other Tracer channels. This sometimes can be very useful to test libraries inner parts. For example suppose that we have MyMover class that we want to write unit test for. And value that we want to test generated as local variables in apply() member function and did not saved as a class members. To test such values we can do the following:

1. In MyMover member function apply output this values to a special Tracer channel:
@code
	MyMover::apply(...) {
		core::util::Tracer test_TR(“protocols.moves.MyMover.test”);
		...
		 test_TR << “Test value 1:” << test_value_1 << “\n”;
		 test_TR << “Test value 2:” << test_value_2 << “\n”;
	}
@endcode

2. In unit test function, before starting testing MyMover class: create UTracer class and redirect core channel “protocols.moves.MyMover.test” to that UTracer object using static Tracer function 'set_ios_hook(VTracerOP tr, std::string monitoring_channels_list);'. So file MyMoverTest.cxxtest.hh can have something like:
@code
	test_MyMover() {
		VTracerOP  UT = new UTracer(“<somepath>/.../MyMover.u”);

		 core::util::set_ios_hook(UT, "protocols.moves.MyMover.test core.scoring"); /// after this line all output to channels  protocols.moves.MyMover.test and core.scoring will be copied in to our UT object.
		...
		MyMover mm(...); // creating MyMover object
		...
		mm.apply(...); // inside apply function  test_value_1 and  test_value_2 will be outputted to channel 'protocols.moves.MyMover.test' and in turn redirected to our UT object.
		...
		core::util::set_ios_hook(0, ""); // stopping redirection.
	}
@endcode
