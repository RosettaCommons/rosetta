#extra_res_fa for CYX residue critical, or else CYX residue type will not be present and cysteine linkage is impossible.  This is needed for UBQ_E2_thioester and UBQ_Gp_CYX-Cterm.  The LYX residue is needed for UBQ_Gp_LYX-Cterm.  Of course the actual paths here will vary based on where your database is...
