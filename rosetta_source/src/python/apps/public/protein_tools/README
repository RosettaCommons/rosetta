This is a collection of classes and scripts that are useful for parsing and analyzing the results of rosetta simulations.  

The library depends on Biopython, which can be downloaded from http://www.biopython.org
To use the graphics package, you will also need to install matplotlib from http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net

The library is divided into 3 packages:

graphics - Classes and functions for graphical output (requires matplotlib)
