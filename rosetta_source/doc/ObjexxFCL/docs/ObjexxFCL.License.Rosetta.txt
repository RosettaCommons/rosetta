("Software").

2.  Licensee acknowledges that this is only a limited nonexclusive license.
Licensor is and remains the owner of all titles, rights, and interests in the

any other copyrighted material except as otherwise provided for in this License.

3.  This License permits use of the Software solely with Licensee's designated
computer software applications ("Applications") as defined in the Addendum.
Neither Licensee nor any other party may use the Software for another purpose
without licensing the Software for that use from Licensor.

4.  This License permits Licensee to make an unlimited number of copies of the
Software and to install the Software on more than one computer system for its
own use with the Applications.  Licensee may modify the Software for use in the
Applications without additional licensing but may not remove the copyright
notice from the Software, charge a fee for the Software, or otherwise imply or
assert ownership of the Software.  A notice may be added to indicate that
portions of the revised Software were added by Licensee and are not covered by
Licensor's copyright notice.

5.  This License permits Licensee to include and distribute the Software in
source or binary form with current and future versions of the Applications
without limitation and without payment to Licensor.  Within the limitations of
the Applications' licensing, those parties may modify the Software for use in

Licensee that the physical medium on which this Software is distributed is free
from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and to the best of
Licensor's knowledge Licensee's use of this Software according to the
documentation is not an infringement of any third party's intellectual property
rights.  This limited warranty lasts for a period of 90 days after delivery.  No
agent of Licensor is authorized to make any other warranties or to modify this
limited warranty.  Any action for breach of this limited warranty must be
commenced within one year of the expiration of the warranty.  Because some
jurisdictions do not allow any limit on the length of an implied warranty, the
above limitation may not apply to this Licensee.  If the law does not allow
disclaimer of implied warranties, then any implied warranty is limited to 90
days after delivery of the Software to Licensee.  Licensee has specific legal
rights pursuant to this warranty and, depending on Licensee's jurisdiction, may
have additional rights.

9.  Licensor DOES NOT WARRANT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET
YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR
ERROR FREE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE
IS WITH YOU.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, Licensor AND
ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WITH REGARD TO THE SOFTWARE AND THE ACCOMPANYING
WRITTEN MATERIALS.  THIS LIMITED WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS.  YOU
MAY HAVE OTHERS WHICH VARY FROM STATE/JURISDICTION TO STATE/JURISDICTION.

10.  THE SOFTWARE IS INTENDED TO BE USED ONLY BY TRAINED PROFESSIONALS AND IS
NOT TO BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT, TESTING, SAFETY AND UTILITY.
Licensor IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE OF ANY RESULTS OBTAINED FROM USING THE
SOFTWARE.

DAMAGES, INCLUDING COMPENSATORY, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, CONNECTED WITH OR RESULTING FROM THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT
OR LICENSEE'S USE OF THIS SOFTWARE.  Licensee's jurisdiction may not allow such
a limitation of damages, so this limitation may not apply.

and indemnify Licensor and hold Licensor harmless from all claims, losses,
damages, complaints, or expenses connected with or resulting from Licensee's
business operations.
